# Odin Project Rock-Paper-Scissors

A clean, interactive implementation of the classic Rock–Paper–Scissors game.  
Built as part of **The Odin Project**, this version features a responsive UI, dynamic score tracking, real-time result messages, and simple but effective visuals.

## What I Learned
This project helped strengthen my understanding of:

- DOM manipulation (`querySelector`, `addEventListener`)
- Event-driven programming  
- Game logic separation (functions for each part)
- Updating HTML elements dynamically  
- Handling win conditions and score logic  
- Writing cleaner, more readable JavaScript code
